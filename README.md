# Overview

An open source alternative for the Panasonic wi-fi adapter that works locally without the cloud.

# Features

* Control your AC locally via Home Assistant, MQTT or directly
* Instantly control the AC without any delay like in the Comfort Cloud app
* Receive live reports and state from the AC
* Uses the UART interface on the AC instead of the IR interface
* Provides a drop-in replacement for the Panasonic DNSK-P11 and the CZ-TACG1 wifi module

# Supported hardware

This library works with both the CN-CNT port and the CN-WLAN port. CN-WLAN is only available on newer units. Either port can be used on units that have both ports regardless of the usage of the other port (ie. it is possible to leave the DNSK-P11 connected to CN-WLAN and connect the ESP to CN-CNT).

Works on the ESP8266 but ESP32 is preferred for the multiple hardware serial ports.

# Requirements

* ESP32 (or ESP8266) ([supported by ESPHome](https://esphome.io/#devices))
* 5V to 3.3V bi-directional Logic Converter (minimum 2 channels, available as pre-soldered prototyping boards)
* Female-Female Jumper cables
* Soldering iron
* Wires to solder from Logic converter to ESP
* Heat shrink
* ESPHome 2025.11.0 or newer
* Home Assistant 2025.11.0 or newer

# Notes

* **Make sure to disconnect mains power before opening your AC, the mains contacts are exposed and can be touched by accident!**
* **Do not connect your ESP32/ESP8266 directly to the AC, the AC uses 5V while the ESPs use 3.3V!**
* **While installation is fairly straightforward I do not take any responsibility for any damage done to you or your AC during installation**
* The DNSK-P11 and the CZ-TACG1 use different types of connectors, make sure to connect to the correct one

# Software installation

This software installation guide assumes some familiarity with ESPHome.

* Pull this repository or copy the `ac.yaml.example` from the root folder
* Rename the `ac.yaml.example` to `ac.yaml`
* Uncomment the `type` field depending on which AC protocol you want to use
* Adjust the `ac.yaml` to your needs
* Connect your ESP
* Run `esphome ac.yaml run` and choose your serial port (or do this via the Home Assistant UI)
* If you see the handshake messages being sent (DNSK-P11) or polling requests being sent (CZ-TACG1) in the log you are good to go
* Disconnect the ESP and continue with hardware installation

## Setting supported features

Since Panasonic ACs support different features you can comment out the lines at the bottom of your `ac.yaml`:

```
  # Enable as needed
  # eco_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Eco Switch
  # nanoex_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC NanoeX Switch
  # mild_dry_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Mild Dry Switch
  # econavi_switch:
  #   name: Econavi switch
  # current_power_consumption:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Power Consumption
```

In order to find out which features are supported by your AC, check the remote that came with it. Please note that eco switch and mild dry switch are not supported on DNSK-P11.

**Enabling unsupported features can lead to undefined behavior and may damage your AC. Make sure to check your remote or manual first.**
**current_power_consumption is just as ESTIMATED value by the AC**

## Limiting the vertical louver positions

The optional `limit_vertical_swing_cool` and `limit_vertical_swing_heat` settings can prevent the vertical louver from moving to unsafe positions. This is useful when a door, cabinet or other obstacle is close to the indoor unit.

```yaml
    vertical_swing_select:
      name: Panasonic AC Vertical Swing Mode

    limit_vertical_swing_cool:
      - up
      - up_center
      - center

    limit_vertical_swing_heat:
      - up_center
      - center
      - down_center
```

Allowed values are `swing`, `auto`, `up`, `up_center`, `center`, `down_center` and `down`. These are the canonical option names and are independent of labels configured through `option_labels`.

Commands selecting a disallowed position are rejected before they are sent. If the AC reports a disallowed position set by another controller, the component restores the last allowed position. A mode change also checks the current position. The `heat_cool` mode uses `limit_vertical_swing_heat`, including its last allowed position and fallback behavior.

The native ESPHome select exposes a fixed option list to API clients. Home Assistant will therefore continue to display every vertical position; selecting a restricted one immediately returns the select to the previous allowed value.

## Poll interval

The optional `poll_interval` setting controls how often the component actively requests the current state from the AC. The default remains `5s` for CN-CNT and `30s` for CN-WLAN.

```yaml
    type: cnt
    poll_interval: 2s
```

A shorter interval makes changes from the remote control or another controller visible sooner, but also increases traffic on the AC interface.

## Setting temperature offsets

As the internal sensors reading might not reflect the actual temperature in the room or outside, you can optionally define a fixed offset for both sensors.
This offset is internally applied to both, the reported temperature in ESPHome/HomeAssistant as well as to the target temperature. Any shown values always include the defined offset.

- Temperature readings of the AC will be reported as (reading + offset)
- Target temperatures will be set as (target - offset)

```
    # Adapt according to your measurements
    current_temperature_offset: 0 
    outside_temperature_offset: 0
```

Examples:
- If the temperature is actually higher than measured by the AC, set the difference as a positive offset.
  - E.g. actual temperature = 23°, AC measured temperature = 20° --> offset = 3°
- If the temperature is actually lower than measured by the AC, set the difference as a negative offset.
  - E.g. actual temperature = 20°, AC measured temperature = 22° --> offset = -2°
